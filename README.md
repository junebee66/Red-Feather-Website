## **🫱 How to Use?**
Once you turn on this software on your mobile devices (phones, or tablets), you will be asked to login to your Google account. Once you're logged in, you will be landing the main view of the app. On the bottom there's 4 buttons to switch around the 4 different functions of the app: Scan, Gallery, Map, and Setting. They are placed in the potential usage order. Once you scan, you are able to see all your spatial video in the gallery view. If you want to share your spatial video to the world, you can add them to the map and also view other's spatial video on the map. Furthermore, if you're more interested in trading your assets you can also put the video on bid.
